Culture: The norms, principles, and practices of an institution

"Culture eats strategy for breakfast" - Peter Drucker


## Lab culture: An anti-example
::: {.incremental style="font-size: 1.4em;"}
- Competitive atmosphere
- High level of secrecy and paranoia
- Pressure to find specific results
- Lack of trust
:::


::: {.notes}
 Lab members are pitted against one another
  - They start out with an office in the cramped "loser room"
  - Publishing a paper in Science/Nature/Cell gets them a seat in a windowed office (and someone else gets kicked back to the "loser room")
- Lab members are forbidden to talk to members of another lab that studies the same topic, located in the same building
- A postdoc is threatened with being fired (and losing their visa status) if they don't find a result consistent with the PI's hypothesis
- The PI once scooped one of their own postdocs
:::


## Lab culture: A pro-example 

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 1.4em;"}
- Collaborative atmosphere
- Openness and transparency
- Trust
:::

::: {.notes}

- Lab members are expliclty encouraged to report any errors they discover in their own work
- All work is discussed openly in the lab, and lab members are encouraged to collaborate
- Lab members are expected to to post their code and data openly upon preprint submission
- Lab members are given space to do good work, and are not pressured to publish before the work is well validated
- Lab members trust that the PI has their best interests in mind
:::



## What are the norms that we want to encourage?

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 1.4em;"}
- Intellectual humility
- Community over competition
- Interpersonal respect and trust
- Openness and transparency
:::

::: {.notes}
- ackonwledge the biases, limitations, and constraints on generalizability of our work
- Work together rather than competing
- Respect the contributions that each person can make, and embrace diversity of the community
- Share data, code, and ideas openly

## How can we develop a culture of open science?

"Incentives drive behavior, and behavior spawns culture." - Rob Asghar

## Aligning the incentives




## Merton's Norms of Science (1942):

- *universalism*
  - "The acceptance or rejection of claims entering the lists of science is not to depend on the personal or social attributes of their protagonist; his race, nationality, religion, class, and personal qualities are as such irrelevant."

## Merton's Norms of Science (1942):

- *universalism*
- *communism*
  - "scientific knowledge as a common property."
  - "The communism of the scientific ethos is incompatible with the definition of technology as 'private property' in a capitalistic economy"

## Merton's Norms of Science (1942):

- *universalism*
- *communism*
- *disinterestedness*
  - scientific institutions act for the benefit of a common scientific enterprise, rather than for the personal gain of individuals within them
  - "Cultism, informal cliques, prolific but trivial publications - these and other techniques may be used for self-aggrandisement. But, in general, spurious claims appear to be negligible and ineffective."

## Merton's Norms of Science (1942):

- *universalism*
- *communism*
- *disinterestedness*
- *organized skepticism*
  - "temporary suspension of judgment and the detached scrutiny of beliefs in terms of empirical and logical criteria"
