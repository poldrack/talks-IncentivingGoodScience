Culture: The norms, principles, and practices of an institution

"Culture eats strategy for breakfast" - Peter Drucker


## Closed-science lab culture
::: {.incremental style="font-size: 1.4em;"}
- Competitive atmosphere
- High level of secrecy and paranoia
- Pressure to find specific results
- Lack of trust
:::


::: {.notes}
 Lab members are pitted against one another
  - They start out with an office in the cramped "loser room"
  - Publishing a paper in Science/Nature/Cell gets them a seat in a windowed office (and someone else gets kicked back to the "loser room")
- Lab members are forbidden to talk to members of another lab that studies the same topic, located in the same building
- A postdoc is threatened with being fired (and losing their visa status) if they don't find a result consistent with the PI's hypothesis
- The PI once scooped one of their own postdocs
:::


## Open-science lab culture

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 1.4em;"}
- Openness and transparency
- Collaborative atmosphere
- Trust
:::

::: {.notes}

- Lab members trust that the PI has their best interests in mind
- PI works to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusiveness
- Lab members are expliclty encouraged to report any errors they discover in their own work
- All work is discussed openly in the lab, and lab members are encouraged to collaborate
- Lab members are expected to to post their code and data openly upon preprint submission
- Lab members are given space to do good work, and are not pressured to publish before the work is well validated
:::

## What are the norms that we want to encourage?

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 1.4em;"}
- Intellectual humility
- Community over competition
- Interpersonal respect and trust
- Openness and transparency
:::

::: {.notes}
- ackonwledge the biases, limitations, and constraints on generalizability of our work
- Work together rather than competing
- Respect the contributions that each person can make, and embrace diversity of the community
- Share data, code, and ideas openly

## Making open science normative

::: {.incremental style="text-align=center; font-size: 1.4em;"}
"Incentives drive behavior, and behavior spawns culture." - Rob Asghar

## Aligning the incentives

::: {style="font-size: 1.4em;"}
- Researchers should be rewarded for doing the right thing
:::

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 1.4em;"}

- Problem:
  - Who makes the decisions about hiring, tenure, and funding?

- HELIOS is a community of practice launched from discussions convened by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s Roundtable on Aligning Incentives for Open Science.  

- At a high level, engagement from colleges and universities has three core components:
  - Presidential Commitment
  - Campus Engagement
  - Community of Practice

## Case study: Changing norms around errors

::: {.incremental style="font-size: 1.4em;"}
- No human enterprise is free from errors
  - E.g. professional software developers make 1-50 errors per 1000 lines of code
- We should view errors as teachable moments
  - But in many labs, errors are viewed as a sign of incompetence

## Errors as a teachable moment: The Morbidity and Mortality Conference as a model

- Aims to identify the root causes of poor outcomes or near-misses
- Focuses on the system, with no blame or finger-pointing

We had posted a preprint describing some issues that we had identified with the stop-signal task in the ABCD Study, along with the code used for all of the analyses.  The ABCD stop-signal team performed a detailed review our code and notified us of an error in the code that resulted in inaccurate estimation of one of the basic behavioral measures on the task (subsequently described in their response to our preprint).
